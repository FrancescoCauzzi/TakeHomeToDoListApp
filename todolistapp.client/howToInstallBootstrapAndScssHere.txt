    + CategoryInfo          : Errore di protezione: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess I did install the CLI globally but I still see this error if I run the previous command

    This error was resolved by this command: Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  But it's suggested that is not safe so to revert this action:
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Restricted
Update(22/11/2023): solve this by removing the ng.ps1 file in the npm directory (path: C:\Users\{your-username}\AppData\Roaming\npm)


Bootstrap:
1. Install Bootstrap:
    Navigate to the root directory of your Angular project in the terminal.
    Run npm install bootstrap to install Bootstrap. This command adds Bootstrap to your project's dependencies.
2. Include Bootstrap in Your Project:
    Open angular.json in your project.
    Add the path to the Bootstrap CSS file in the styles array. It should look something like "./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
3. Include Bootstrap JavaScript:
    In Angular, it's best to include JavaScript files in the angular.json file under the "scripts" array, which is part of the "architect/build/options" section.
    Add the path to Bootstrap's JavaScript bundle:
  "scripts": [
  "./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
  ]
4. Rebuild the application (the ng commands does not work and I     had to restart the server from Vistual Studio IDE)



SCSS:
1. Updating an Existing Angular App to Use SCSS:

    To update your CLI configuration for SCSS, there are two approaches:

      1. Using the CLI Command: Execute ng config schematics.@schematics/angular:component.styleext scss in your terminal. This command might modify the angular.json in the wrong place, so ensure it is modified correctly under your project​.

      2. (I used this one) Manually Adding to angular.json: Add the following schematics reference to your angular.json file:
      "schematics": {
        "@schematics/angular:component": {
          "style": "scss"
        }
      },

2. After installing Bootstrap (npm install bootstrap), you can import Bootstrap SCSS in your styles.scss file:
@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss";

3. modify all the old path strings referring to .css file to .scss file in the angula.json configuration file and also in the app.conponents.ts
